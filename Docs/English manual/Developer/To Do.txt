To Do:
-----

-Line 7216, GO SUB 246:GO TO 95, look at more similar lines and simplify if possible (7237). -- WHAT? --

-If the character is not a multiple of 8 (it has been shifted up or down), the block can
 be edited if the cursor is previously in a write-protected area, even if the other part
 of the block is in a write-protected area.

-That the loading does not destroy parts of the program. -- THERE ARE NO PLANS TO FIX THIS, BE CAREFUL WHEN LOADING --

-Check all the save and load possibilities on all popular Spectrum models.


About selection marks:
---------------------

 -Look what the loop does when it checks whether the variables area and the MH charsets routine
  are going to be deleted with SShift+X or +Z and simplify it..	-- FIXED, I THINK --

 -It does not check if an area of ​​the ROM is going to be erased.	-- FIXED --

 -Address 00000 cannot be selected.	-- THIS IS GOING TO STAY LIKE THAT, I THINK... --

 -Addresses do not appear with leading zeros in decimal selection marks. -- FIXED --


Remove when compiling:
---------------------

 -Delete ALL lines starting with a REM. -- DONE --

 -Delete ALL spaces at the beginning of subroutines.

 -Change ALL CODE = "*" to the character number.

 -Change ALL VAL "number" to just the number. Compiled it takes up less space, I think.

 -Checking if help exists. -- NO LONGER BUILT-IN HELP --

 -Delete the lines: 1
