					--------------------

	> Integer numeric variables POSINT (INT+, with sign, between 0 and 65535):
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------

		>Temporaries:

 b: It is used on many occasions.
 c: Used for Inkey$ code. Reused several times.
 f: It is only used at the moment to indicate the starting address for poking 16 bits into memory.
 g: It is only used at the moment to indicate the value to poke in the 'f' variable.
 n: Used in some nested IF...NEXT loops. Reused multiple times.
 r: It is used on multiple occasions.
 z: Used in almost all IF...NEXT loops. Reused several times.
di: Address to change the CHARS System variable. It is refused several times.

		>Fixed:

 a: Clipboard copying Mode. Char (1), byte (0), clean clipboard (2).
 d: Address of the first byte of the selected character.
 h: Hexadecimal/decimal mode. Decimal (0), Hexadecimal (1).
 i: The border color, blue (1) or black (0).
 p: Y position of the yellow selection bar (0-7). (in EDIT MODE) Used for the Y
    coordinate of the grid (0-7). --Y: ^ Vertical axis (height) --
 u: UDGs bar activation. Off (0), On (1)?, change(2)?.
ag: Sprites/AGD mode. On (1), Off (0).
ar: Determines the area (of the Area bar) in which we are.
bi: Binary mode (1) or pixels (0).
br: It is used in drawing the pixel on the grid, I think to know if it deactivates or activates it.
dr: (in EDIT MODE) Pixel On (1), Off (0).
ed: Edit mode active/inactive. In Edit Mode (1), in Viewer Mode (0).
ee: It is activated when exiting Edit Mode. You have just exited (1), you have not just exited (0).
ex: (in EDIT MODE) Used for the X coordinate of the grid. --X: > Horizontal axis (width) --
ic: The colour of the character being edited, in that little window with the box.
md: Spectrum mode. 48k (0), 128/+2 (1), +2A/B/+3 -without disc- (2), +2A/B -with disc-/+3 (3).
ol: It is used in drawing the pixel on the grid, to store the value of the colour attribute.
ox: (in EDIT MODE) Used for the old X coordinate of the grid.
oy: (in EDIT MODE) Used for the old Y coordinate of the grid.
pa: Grid paper colour (0-7).
ro: It is used when copying and pasting, I think to know if you are copying a byte or a char.
sb: Seamless Background mode. On (1), Off (0).
sv: Used to specify whether to draw the Save or Load menu, and act accordingly.
tn: The colour of the grid background dots (the disabled pixels).
tp: The colour of the ink (the lit pixels) of the grid.
zz: Draw Char or just a byte. Char(7), byte(1).


	> Integer numeric variables INTEG (INT, signed, between -32768 and 32767):
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------

os: Specifies the offset of the Sprites bar.


	> Other numeric variables (REAL):
	--------------------------------

 k: Temporary signed REAL number variable (5 bytes).


	> Alphanumeric variables (STRING$ - text strings):
	-------------------------------------------------

h$: Data sequence of 8 hexadecimal numbers (16 characters long). Reused several
    times to convert from hexadecimal to decimal.					-Length: 50
i$: It is used for the upper text (where the Spectrum mode is set).			-Length: 24
k$: It is used for the checkered pattern of the brightness of the grille,
    and surely in more places.								-Length: 27
m$: ON pixel format in the grid. It is reused in many cases.				-Length: 25
n$: Pixel format OFF in grid. Reused on many occasions.					-Length: 24
v$: Value of one byte. Occasionally reused.						-Length: 5


	> Arrays:
	--------

 p(): One-dimensional array with 11 slots.
b$(): Two-dimensional array (16,12). -Length: ¿192?


	> User functions:
	----------------

 e (fn): DEF FN e(h$,z)	 Function -Hex2Dec- to convert 8-bit values ​​from hexadecimal to decimal
	 (z=1, from 0x00h to 0xFFh). The local variable 'z' is the position of the local string 'h$'
	 from which it reads. -- POSINT unsigned --
h$ (fn): DEF FN h$(z)	 Function -Dec2Hex- to convert 8-bit values ​​(0 to 255) from decimal to
	 hexadecimal. The local variable 'z' is the number to enter (0-255). -- STRING$ --


	> Numerical dummy variables:
	---------------------------

 z: Used as a local dummy in 'e (fn)' -> DEF FN e(h$,z) and in 'h$ (fn)' -> DEF FN h$(z).
h$: Used as a local dummy in 'e (fn)' -> DEF FN e(h$,z).
