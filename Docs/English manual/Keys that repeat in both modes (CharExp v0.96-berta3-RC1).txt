Both in View Mode and Edit Mode the following keys are repeated:
---------------------------------------------------------------

 Although these keys are listed in the manual, I've listed them here so you know which ones are the same (and
 do exactly the same thing) in the two modes. All other keys differ, even though they do the same action.

	>B: Binary mode.

	>G: Change the grid background colour.
	>CShift + G: Changes the colour of the background dots (inactive pixels) of the grid.
	>SShift + K: Changes the ink colour (active pixels) of the grid.

	>CShift + D: Delete current char.		>CShift + Z: Delete the yellow selected row (byte).

	>F: Flip the char vertically.			>CShift + F: Flip the char horizontally.

	>SShift + 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Sinclair Joystick): 'Accommodate' the char in grid.
	>SShift + 0 (Shot on Sinclair Joystick): Invert the char.

	>CShift + Q: Goes to Basic (type RUN to reload the program).


 This is because in each mode they have a different use, and it would be a major hassle for the keyboard
 organization to try to change them, although I'm open to recommendations...
