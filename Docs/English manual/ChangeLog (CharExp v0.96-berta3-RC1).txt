v0.96 Berta3 (??-?-2023):
------------------------

-Fixed a major bug that prevented loading/saving.

-Offset added to Sprite mode on Edit Mode. You can change it with the '1' and '2' keys, and reset it with '3'.

-Now in Edit Mode, you can move the cursor without limits (you exit from one side and enter from the opposite).

-Fixed various cosmetic bugs.

-Fixed some minor bugs.


v0.96 Berta2:
------------

-Base program help has been removed to free up memory for the user. Help can now be loaded separately (in
 another emulator instance, for example). A 128 style menu has been added to the help.

 Now the H key that previously accessed help, changes the color of the screen border to black (in case you don't
 like the default blue).

-The program has been moved to another memory location. Before it started around 32637, now it starts at 25200,
 where help started before. This has been done so that the free memory remains more or less sequentially, although
 it's true that the MicroHobby charsets selection routine and certain variables and data of the program remains in
 between.

-The keys to displace the char around the grid have been modified to match the Sinclair 1 Joystick. Joystick
 Sinclair 1 support has also been added to Edit Mode for moving the cursor.
