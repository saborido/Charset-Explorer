					- CharSet Explorer v1.0 RC1 Known bugs -

Aesthetic bugs:
---------------

-It has happened in a +2A/B in 128k mode, when entering the Save/Load menu (specifically in the Save menu), neither Tape
 nor RAM has been chosen (by default it's Tape). I remember trying the key that changes it (the T key) several times, and
 when exiting and re-entering neither of the two options appeared selected (if you press the T key, then back to work
 correctly). It only happened once and I haven't been able to reproduce it again.


Minor bugs:
-----------

-In Edit Mode, you can displace left from the beginning of MicroHobby charset A and get into the red protected zone (MH
 routine area, program variables, and the program itself). It doesn't let you edit them (so that's fine).


'Normal' bugs:
--------------

-If you have moved the grid by a number that is not a multiple of 8, you may be able to edit a portion of memory that should
 be write-protected.

-In Edit Mode, when displacing with CShift + O and P, sometimes the character is inverted (usually I have seen it with the
 P key). This happened after 'arranging' the lines for the code weighs less. It happened several times, but after continuing
 coding I can no longer reproduce it.


Killer Bugs (it cause to crash the program):
--------------------------------------------

-When you put the finish selection mark in 65535 and delete it with SShift + Z (or move with SShift + X), the program
 crashes (at least in the compiled one). I don't know why...

-When loading from certain pointers (current position, mark, etc.) you can override the program's own code and cause it
 to crash. Be careful when loading. -- I DON'T THINK I'LL PATCH IT, I'M LOW ON MEMORY AND I DON'T THINK I'LL REMEMBER TO DO
 IT... --
